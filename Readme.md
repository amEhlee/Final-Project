# RPG FINAL PROJECT FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE 30
--------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a quick project I made for my final in computer science 30.
In this project we work to make a quick and fun rougelike that runs straight off the terminal where the player can interact with things. 
It was made for the purpose of  helping us apply our knowledge of classes and working with larger arrays

--------------------------------------------------------------
# Whats it about?
--------------------------------------------------------------
It is a very quick and easy rpg game that plays off the terminal. 
The play is able to move in a 2d array map and interact with things like items and monsters.

The end goal of every attempt is in trying to get towards the exit square, though keys can unlock things along the way.

# Dev Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------

This was a pretty awesome project to work on and has been a massive precusor to some of my later / revised projects like space.py.
Here I was able to work concepts like use of 2d maps, player interactions, text and decision making as well as construction of a larger battle system where the player can interact with the monsters. (Sort of like Undertale, but GREATLY simplified)

# End Notes and Credits
--------------------------------------------------------------

Not much to say here maybe one day ill revisit this and actually give it a name lmao. 
Credits to Stephenie Meyer for all the twilight series where I pulled half the quotes from. I take no credit in its creation.
Credits to Mr Troung. You were a f!@$ing awesome teacher who made this entire project possible just in helping me out and giving loads of advice even with the pandemic raging in the back. Stay up!

Either way its super scuffed but enjoy the game
